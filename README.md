# Resume Clips Client


## About
  Resume Clips is an app for storing and organizing all of the content you might want to include on a resume. Not everyone took a direct path from high school to the field we are currently working in or would like to work in. As such, we often need different resumes for applying to different positions. What is relevant to one company or industry isn't relevant to another. With Reume Clips, you can keep track of ALL your information to easily reference it when you tweak your resume.
